\section{Conditional Probability}

%
\begin{frame}

Suppose we know that one event $B$ has already happened or will happen (the
condition), and we want to know the probability of different event $A$.

\hfill

Then the \textbf{conditional probability of $A$ given $B$} is defined by

$$ P(A \mid B) = \frac{\text{\# of ways A and B \textbf{both} happen}}{\text{\#
of ways B can happen}} $$

\end{frame}

What is the conditional probability that you draw a hand containing a three of a
kind, given that you draw a hand containing a pair?

\begin{align*}
P(\text{Drawing a} & \text{ three of a kind} \mid \text{Drawing a pair}) = \\ 
&= \frac{\text{\# of ways of drawing a three of a kind}}{\text{\# of ways of
drawing a pair}}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Important}: Any hand containing a three of a kind \textbf{automatically}
contains a pair!

\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}

$$ \text{\# of ways of drawing a three of a kind} = 13 \times {{4}\choose{3}}
\times {{49}\choose{2}} = 61152 $$

$$ \text{\# of ways of drawing a pair} = 13 \times {{4}\choose{2}}
\times {{50}\choose{3}} = 1528800 $$

\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}

\begin{align*}
P(\text{Drawing a} & \text{ three of a kind} \mid \text{Drawing a pair}) = \\ 
&= \frac{61152}{1528800} \\
&= 0.04
\end{align*}

\end{frame}
%

There is another way to look at conditional probabilities

\begin{align*}
P(A & \mid B) & \\
%
&= \frac{\text{\# of ways A and B \textbf{both} happen}}{\text{\#
of ways B can happen}} \\[0.5ex]
%
&= \frac{\frac{\text{\# of ways A and B \textbf{both} happen}}{\text{Total \# of
things that can happen}}}{\frac{\text{\# of ways B can happen}}{\text{Total \# of
things that can happen}}} \\[0.5ex]
%
&= \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}
\end{align*}

\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}

So we could have instead computed:

\begin{align*}
P(\text{Drawing a} & \text{ three of a kind} \mid \text{Drawing a pair}) = \\
%
&= \frac{P(\text{Drawing a three of a kind})}{P(\text{Drawing a pair})} \\
%
&= \frac{\frac{61152}{2598960}}{\frac{1528800}{2598960}} \\
%
&= \frac{0.024}{0.588} \\
%
&= 0.04
\end{align*}

\end{frame}

What is the conditional probability that you draw a full house, given that you know you
have at least a three of a kind?

\begin{align*}
P(\text{Drawing a} & \text{ full house} \mid \text{Drawing a three of a kind}) = \\
%
&= \frac{\text{\# of ways of drawing a full house}}{\text{\# of ways of drawing
a three of a kind}} \\
%
&= \frac{ 13 \times {{4}\choose{3}} \times 12 \times {{4}\choose{2}} } {13
\times {{4}\choose{3}} \times {{50}\choose{2}}} \\
%
&= \frac{3744}{63700} \\
%
&= 0.059
\end{align*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
What is the conditional probability that you draw a full house, given that you
have drawn a four of a kind?

What is the conditional probability that you draw a four of a kind, given that
you know you already have a pair?
