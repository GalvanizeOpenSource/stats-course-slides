\textbf{Probability} refers to the study of patterns in a random process.

\hfill

When we solve problems in probability we assume that all basic features of the random process are \textbf{known}, and our goal is to discover other, deeper features.

For example:

\hfill

If I have a coin which is \textbf{known} to land heads exactly half of the time, it is a problem in \textbf{probability} to determine how often the coin will never land on heads over ten consecutive flips.

\textbf{Statistics} refers to the study of random process where some basic features of the random process are \textbf{unknown}, and our goal is to \textbf{infer from observations} basic, hidden features of the random process.

For example:

\hfill

It is a problem in \textbf{statistics} to determine, when presented with a coin which has landed tails ten consecutive times, whether one should continue to believe it fair.
