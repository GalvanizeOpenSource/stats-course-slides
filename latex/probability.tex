\section{Probability Basics}

\begin{frame}

An \textbf{outcome} is a single thing that can happen.

\hfill

An \textbf{event} is a collection of things that can happen, usually given by a
short description.

\end{frame}

For example:

\hfill

When thinking about poker hands, an \textbf{outcome} is a single hand (any
unordered collection of five cards).

\hfill

The collection of all full houses, three of a kinds, etc. are \textbf{events}.

\end{frame}


%
\begin{frame}

The \textbf{probability} of an event is

$$ P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{\# of ways event can happen}}{\text{total \# of
things that can happen}} $$

So to compute basic probabilities, we use our knowledge from counting.

\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}

$$ P(\text{full-house}) = \frac{\text{\# of full houses}}{\text{total \# of
hands}} $$

\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}

$$ \text{\# of full houses} = 13 \times 6 \times 12 \times 4 = 3744 $$

$$ \text{total \# of hands} = {{52}\choose{5}} = 2598960 $$

\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}

$$ P(\text{full-house}) = \frac{3744}{2598960} = 0.0014 $$

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

What is the probability of drawing a hand containing a three of a kind?

\hfill

What is the probability of drawing a hand containing a three of a kind \textbf{that is
not a full house}?

\hfill

What is the probability of drawing a hand containing a pair, \textbf{that does
not contain a three of a kind or four of a kind}?

\end{frame}
